Welcome to the Emotion Detector project! This Flutter-based app uses your device's camera to identify and classify emotions from facial expressions in real-time. 🤩  We aim to create an interactive and engaging experience for users to understand their emotional states.

*   **Happy 😄**
*   **Crying 😭**
